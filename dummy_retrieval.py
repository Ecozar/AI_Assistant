"""
DUMMY RETRIEVAL SYSTEM
---------------------
!!! TEMPORARY PLACEHOLDER !!!
This module simulates the retrieval and response generation that will be replaced 
by a local LLM (likely deepseek-r1:8B via ollama) in the final implementation.

Current Purpose:
1. Acts as a placeholder to test memory and embedding systems
2. Demonstrates the intended RAG workflow
3. Provides a clean interface for future LLM integration
4. Enables development of surrounding infrastructure

This module will be replaced when LLM integration is implemented.
DO NOT ADD CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY HERE - focus on interface design.

This module serves as a crucial placeholder that:
1. Demonstrates the intended retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflow
2. Tests the memory and embedding systems without LLM dependency
3. Provides a clean interface for future LLM integration

Project Context:
- Part of the AI Assistant Brain Project's phased development
- Currently uses dummy responses while building robust memory foundation
- Will be replaced by local LLM (e.g., deepseek-r1:8B via ollama) in future
- Must maintain same interface when LLM is integrated

Technical Constraints:
- Must use same embedding model as rest of system
- Must demonstrate realistic prompt construction
- Must handle both conversation history and document chunks
- Must support offline operation

    """
    Simulates RAG-based response generation.
    
    This class demonstrates the intended workflow:
    1. Compute embeddings for query
    2. Retrieve relevant context from memory
    3. Construct prompt with context
    4. Generate response (currently dummy)
    
    The interface is designed to match future LLM integration:
    - Takes same inputs (query, conversation history)
    - Returns similar response structure
    - Uses same memory retrieval methods
